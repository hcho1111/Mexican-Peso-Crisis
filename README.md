# Mexican-Peso-Crisis

This is an econometrics paper testing trust in one's government during periods of economic distress. I utilize the Mexican Peso Crisis, which took place in the 1994, as a natural experiment to test theoretical levels of trust. 

Included is socioeconomic data and a trust index for Latin American countries. Tables, data, supporting papers, and my final report are included.
